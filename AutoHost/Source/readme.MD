Source code for the basic version of the auto-host bot. This one will eventually be transformed to be used for auto-hosting bot vs bot games for machine learning (and perhaps bot vs human games as well).
Can be used to auto-host your own games, though I only use it atm to have something that can automatically link a discord and post the rules on command
